- Building an element name dinamically
- CSS Stylings

How to play:

The scope of the game is to get to 25 points, and on each round hold the current score before one of the dices hits 1.
1. When the player presses 'Roll Dice', the 'CURRENT' tab will hold the current score, based on the sum of the dices.
2. If one of the dices is 1, the current score will be lost and it will be the next player turn to roll the dices.
3. If the player presses 'Hold' before one of the dices hits 1, the current score will be saved to the main score, and then the turn will be switched to the next player.
4. First to main score 25 wins :)
